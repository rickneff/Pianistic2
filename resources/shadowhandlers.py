# This file contains resources handlers intended to hide static
# resources.  To add a shadow, add the file or directory name
# to the dictionary as the key name, with the value shadow.
# Shadow handlers can only hide resources in the webroot.
# Directories that are shadowed will also hide all of their
# contents.



# Resource request handler index
# After each resource handler function, that function should be added
# to this dictionary.
# For an enumeration of resources, run this program as a standalone.

# Shadow resources (for hiding files)
# Note that these will only hide resources in the webroot.
# Shadowed directories in webroot will be entirely inaccessible
# from the browser (this includes are files in them).  Files
# in subdirectories of webroot cannot be individually
# shadowed, but files in webroot can.

# Any resources that need to be shadowed should
# point to this function.
